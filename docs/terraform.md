 ## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

Terraform is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language. 
It allows managing infrastructure as code, which means it's possible to write, put it under version control, and share the infrastructure configuration.
In Horizon platfrom terraform is used to create the infrastucture in GCP (Google Cloud Platform).

## Overview 

Teraform scripts in Horizon SDV project define and create GCP infrastructure and configure services using terraform code.
Terraform use declarative language to describe the desired state of infrastructure, and takes care of provisioning and managing the resources to match that state.
GCP is used as a cloud platform for creating and configuring infrastructure, hosts, and other services that are needed by Horizon SDV platform. Google Cloud is also used in the Horizon SDV project for managing secrets and running scripts that interact with the Standard GKE cluster through Fleet. 
Main list of resources created by terraform scripts in the GCP Cloud is mentioned below:

- GKE Cluster (Google Kubernetes Engine Cluster) with 2 node pool:
  - sdv-node-pool - used for Horizon SDV services
  - sdv-build-node-pool - used for workloads
- Main Horizon SDV Service Account, required secrets and other Service Accounts for GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)
- Artifact Registry to store, docker images for services eg. Landing Paga, Post Jobs, Cron Jobs and AAOS Builder
- Certificate Manager, Certificate Manager Map and DNS authorization resources - for managing the TLS certificate
- GCS (Google Cloud Storage) - storage bucket that stores Android build output results, infastructure state and deployment helper script
- IAM (Identity and Access Management) area that helps managing IAM roles for users and Service Accounts
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - that configures the Horizon SDV plaform networking
- Secret Manager - stores all Horizon SDV platform required secrets, most of them are then bridged to the inside if GKE Kubernetes Cluster

Terraform implementation in the Horizon SDV poject repository is organized into following subdirectories:

- modules - implementation of the terraform modules
- env - stores all environmetn specific configuration options (most of them are needed to be provided up front with either `local-env.sh` script or with GitHub Workflows execution pipeline)


## Modules Overview

Main entry point for terraform execution is `env/main.tf` file. This file contains all input configuration parameters that are needed to be provided before execution. List of input configuration parameters is provided in the `local-env.sh` file which can be modified and sourced if there is a need of running terraform manually. If GitHub Workflows are used - all these input variables are provided automatically.

- sdv_github_app_id (Github Application ID)
- sdv_github_app_install_id (GitHub Installation ID)
- sdv_github_app_private_key (GitHub Application Private Key)
- git_auth_method (Authentication method either app (GitHub) or pat)
- sdv_git_pat (Git Personal Access Token)
- sdv_jenkins_admin_password (Jenkins initial admin account password)
- sdv_keycloak_admin_password (Keycloak initial admin account password)
- sdv_gerrit_admin_password (Gerrit initial admin accont password)
- sdv_gerrit_ssh_private_key (Gerrit initial admin SSH private key)
- sdv_keycloak_horizon_admin_password (Keycloak initial horizon realm admin account password)
- sdv_cuttlefish_ssh_private_key (GCE SSH access to Cuttlefish VMs private key)
- sdv_git_repo_name (Repository Name)
- sdv_git_repo_owner (Repository Owner: GitHub Organization name or Git user name who owns the Git repo)
- sdv_env_name (Environment and SubDomain name)
- sdv_root_domain (Top level Domain Name)
- sdv_gcp_project_id (GCP Project ID)
- sdv_gcp_compute_sa_email (Main GCE Computer Service Account)
- sdv_gcp_region (GCP Cloud Region)
- sdv_gcp_zone (GCP Cloud Zone)
- sdv_gcp_backend_bucket (GCP Backend Bucket to store tfstate)
- enable_arm64 (Toggle to enable or disable ARM64 support)
- manual_secrets (Set Application Admin secret manually)



Each module directory should contain files eg:
- `main.tf` - main terraform implementation file
- `variables.tf` - variables definition
- `output.tf` - (optional) - output variable definition 

env/main.tf file include all modules by its dependencies:

1. `base` - Define all list of needed modules. Each module defines source path, dependency and needed data eg. resource name, project_id, network data etc. 
2. `sdv-apis` - Defines list of google APIs to include. APIs is needed to most implementation modules.
3. `sdv-artifact-registry` - Defines restistry and roles for Artifacts Registry resource. Registry is an universal package manager for build artifacts and dependencies.
4. `sdv-certificate-manager` - Define certificate manager maps and DNS authorization for specific domain.
5. `sdv-container-images` - Build and push container images to Artifact Registry.
6. `sdv-dns-zone` - Create and manage Cloud DNS Zone for the environment. Manages DNS records within it.
7. `sdv-gcs` - Creates Google Cloud Storage and Storage Bucket for the project.
8. `sdv-gke-apps` - Module which deployes essential apps once the Standard GKE cluster has been provisioned.
9. `sdv-gke-cluster` - Defines Google Kubernetes Engine Cluster for project with proper configuration and properties.
10. `sdv-iam` - Configures IAM roles for users and Service Accounts.
11. `sdv-network` - Configures networking including, subnets, IP address ranges and filrewall.
12. `sdv-parameters` - Manages configuration data in Google Parameter Manager. Store non-sensitive environment data.
13. `sdv-sa-key-secret` - Creates a JSON Key from the defined SA and saves it as a GCP Secret. Gives access to the defined GKE Service Account to the created secret.
14. `sdv-secrets` - Creates required secrets and gives the access to the defined Kubernetes Service Accounts.
15. `sdv-ssh-keypair` - Module to Generate SSH keys and saves them to local files.
16. `sdv-ssl-policy` - Creates a SSL Policy. SSL policies specify the set of SSL features that GCP load balancers use when negotiating SSL with clients. 
17. `sdv-wi` - module creates GCP Service Accounts which are going to be used in various parts of the Horizon SDV project ensuring a trust relationship between them. It helps using these account without setting any additional authentication methods like passwords. Also assigns required roles to these Service Accounts.

Defines a subnet within the VPC with the following configurations:
- Private IP Google Access: Disables private IP Google access.

Module defines secondary IP ranges (secondary_ranges) for the subnet, which are used to differentiate GKE internal resources within the Cluster such as pod ranges and services ranges.
Module configure also route within the VPC with the following configurations:
- Route Name and Description: Specifies the route name and description.
- Destination Range: Sets the destination range for the route (any IP address)
- Sets the next hop to the internet gateway (IGW).
- Enables private IP Google access.

## Module - sdv-parameters

Defines replication policy of secret attached to the Secret.

## Module - sdv-secrets
Module manages secrets in Google Cloud Secret Manager by creating secrets, their versions, and setting IAM bindings for access control.The secrets are replicated to location. Resource "google_secret_manager_secret_version" "sdv_gsmsv_use_git_value"  creates secret versions for secrets that use GitHub values. It ignores changes to the secret data and depends on the creation of the secret resource. Resource "google_secret_manager_secret_version" "sdv_gsmsv_dont_use_git_value" creates secret versions for secrets that do not use GitHub values. It depends on the creation of both the secret resource and the secret versions that use GitHub values. 'secret_iam_binding his' sets IAM bindings for each secret, granting the roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor role to specified members.

## Module - sdv-ssh-keypair
Module to Generate SSH keys required for Gerrit and Cuttlefish VMs. Converts the generated keys into required format and saves them to local files with required file system permissions.

## Module - sdv-ssl-policy
Module creates SSL policy to be used by the cluster. Profile and name is set.

## Module - sdv-wi
Module Workload Identity is used to manage Google Cloud Service Accounts and their roles. Key components:
- google_service_account.sdv_wi_sa: Creates service accounts for each entry in var.wi_service_accounts.
- flattened_roles_with_sa and flattened_gke_sas: Flattens the roles associated with each service account into a list.
- roles_with_sa_map and gke_sas_with_sa_map: Maps each role-service account combination to a unique key.
- google_project_iam_member.sdv_wi_sa_iam_2 and sdv_wi_sa_wi_users_gke_ns_sa: Assigns roles to service accounts based on roles_with_sa_map.
In case of GKE assigns the roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser role to GKE service accounts based on gke_sas_with_sa_map.


## Execute terraform scripts
The automated deployment scripts are located in `tools/scripts/deployment/`. These scripts standardize the deployment of the Horizon SDV platform infrastructure to the required GCP Project.

### What the script does
1. Requirements Check
2. Authentication Check
3. Terraform Initialization
4. Execution (Terraform apply or destroy based on supplied flag)

**Path**: `tools/scripts/deployment/`
**Main deployment script**: `deploy.sh`
**Container wrapper**: `container-deploy.sh` (Requires Docker to be installed on the host machine)

### Execution methods
There are two ways to run the deployment. Via Docker and Host Machine.

#### Docker
This runs the deployment script within a containerized environment. You do not need to install Terraform, Kubectl, or the specific Gcloud CLI version on your local machine, only Docker is required.

**Script Path**: `/tools/scripts/deployment/`
**Dockerfile Path**: `/tools/scripts/deployment/container/`
**Command**: 
```shell
./container-deploy.sh [args]
```

1. Builds the horizon-sdv-deployer Docker container image with pinned tool versions (Terraform, Kubectl, gcloud).
2. Creates a persistent Docker Volume to store `gcloud` login credentials.
3. Mounts current code (repository) directory into the container.
4. Executes `deploy.sh` within the container.

**First Run**: You will be prompted to authenticate by clicking/copying a link and pasting a code. Credentials are **saved to the volume**.

#### Host Machine
Runs the script directly on host machine. Ensure all the tools with the required versions are installed.

**Prerequisites**:
- Terraform `v1.14.2+`
- Kubectl `v1.34.3+`
- Google Cloud CLI `v549.0.1+`
- Authenticated gcloud session (gcloud auth login)

**Script Path**: `/tools/scripts/deployment`
**Command**: 
```shell
./deploy.sh [args]
```

### Arguments usage
Both scripts (Containerized and Host Machine) accept the same arguments, which are passed directly to Terraform.

#### Deploy (Apply):
- Initializes Terraform and runs `terraform apply -auto-approve`.   

**Containerized**:
```shell
./container-deploy.sh
```

**Host Machine**:
```shell
./deploy.sh
```

### Destroy (Teardown):
Initializes Terraform and runs `terraform destroy -auto-approve`.

**Containerized**:
```shell
./container-deploy.sh -d
```

**Host Machine**:
```shell
./deploy.sh -d
```
> Note: You can also use `--destroy`.
