## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

During developing the OpenBSW workload and workflow/pipelines, sometimes it may be necessary to gain access to a VM build instance in order to develop build jobs.

Users may gain access via MTK Connect HOST interface by selecting `MTK_CONNECT_ENABLE`, alternatively accessing the pod using `kubectl`, e.g.

```
kubectl exec -it -n jenkins <pod name> -- bash
```
Reference [Fleet management](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/enterprise/multicluster-management/gateway) to fetch credentials for a fleet-registered cluster to be used in Connect Gateway, e.g.
- `gcloud container fleet memberships list`
- `gcloud container fleet memberships get-credentials sdv-cluster`

**Note:**
- These instances only remain active for a limited time, defined by `INSTANCE_MAX_UPTIME`.
- User can find `<pod name>` from either the Jenkins UI console log or from the Jenkins Build Executor nodes.
- Users are responsible for managing their work and saving to their own storage, that's beyond the purpose of this job.

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

One-time setup requirements.

- Before running this pipeline job, ensure that the following template has been created by running the corresponding job:
  - Docker image template: `OpenBSW/Environment/Docker Image Template`

## Environment Variables/Parameters <a name="environment-variables"></a>

**Jenkins Parameters:** Defined in the groovy job definition `groovy/job.groovy`.

### `IMAGE_TAG`

Specifies the name of the Docker image to be used when running this job.

The default value is defined by the `Seed Workloads` pipeline job. Users may override to provide a unique tag that describes the Linux distribution and tool chain versions.

### `INSTANCE_MAX_UPTIME`

This is the maximum time that the instance may be running before it is automatically terminated and deleted. This is important to avoid leaving expensive instances in running state.

### `MTK_CONNECT_ENABLE`

Enable if user wishes to connect to the HOST via MTK Connect.

### `MTK_CONNECT_PUBLIC`

When checked, the MTK Connect testbench is visible to everyone and can be shared.
By default, testbenches are private and only visible to their creator and MTK Connect administrators.

### `NUM_HOST_INSTANCES`

Number of host instances to create for testing the POSIX application. This is effectively the number of devices that
will be created associated with the development instance testbench in MTK Connect.

## SYSTEM VARIABLES <a name="system-variables"></a>

There are a number of system environment variables that are unique to each platform but required by Jenkins build, test and environment pipelines.

These are defined in Jenkins CasC `values-jenkins.yaml` and can be viewed in Jenkins UI under `Manage Jenkins` -> `System` -> `Global Properties` -> `Environment variables`.

These are as follows:

-   `OPENBSW_BUILD_DOCKER_ARTIFACT_PATH_NAME`
    - Defines the registry path where the Docker image used by builds, tests and environments is stored.

-   `CLOUD_PROJECT`
    - The GCP project, unique to each project. Important for bucket, registry paths used in pipelines.

-   `CLOUD_REGION`
    - The GCP project region. Important for bucket, registry paths used in pipelines.

-   `HORIZON_DOMAIN`
    - The URL domain which is required by pipeline jobs to derive URL for tools and GCP.

-   `HORIZON_GIT_URL`
    - The URL to the Horizon SDV git repository.

-   `HORIZON_GIT_BRANCH`
    - The branch name the job will be configured for from `HORIZON_GIT_URL`.

-   `JENKINS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
    - Service account to use for pipelines. Required to ensure correct roles and permissions for GCP resources.
