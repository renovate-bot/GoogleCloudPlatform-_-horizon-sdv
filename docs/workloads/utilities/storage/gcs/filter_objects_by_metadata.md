## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This job allows the user to list all objects in a bucket path based on the metadata that is set on them.
The user can choose to list objects with specific metadata (matching the provided key and/or value),
objects with any metadata or objects with no metadata.

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

Run the `Jenkins → Utilities → Docker Image Template` to create a container for kubernetes that will support this job.

## SYSTEM VARIABLES <a name="system-variables"></a>

There are a number of system environment variables that are unique to each platform but required by Jenkins build, test and environment pipelines.

These are defined in Jenkins CasC `values-jenkins.yaml` and can be viewed in Jenkins UI under `Manage Jenkins` -> `System` -> `Global Properties` -> `Environment variables`.
These are as follows:

-   `UTILITIES_DOCKER_ARTIFACT_PATH_NAME`
    - Defines the registry path where the Docker image used to create the ABFS Server and Uploader VM instances.

-   `CLOUD_PROJECT`
    - The GCP project, unique to each project. Important for bucket, registry paths used in pipelines.

-   `CLOUD_REGION`
    - The GCP project region. Important for bucket, registry paths used in pipelines.

-   `HORIZON_GIT_URL`
    - The URL to the Horizon SDV git repository.

-   `HORIZON_GIT_BRANCH`
    - The branch name the job will be configured for from `HORIZON_GIT_URL`.

-   `JENKINS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
    - Service account to use for pipelines. Required to ensure correct roles and permissions for GCP resources.
