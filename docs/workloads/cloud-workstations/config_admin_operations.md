## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The Jenkins folder `Cloud Workstations > Config Admin Operations` provides a set of six admin-level pipelines to manage the Cloud Workstation Configurations - which are like blueprints used by Workstations on GCP. These pipelines use `Terraform` to manage infrastructure resources on GCP. The six pipelines are:
- `Create New Configuration`
- `Delete Existing Configuration`
- `Update Existing Configuration`
- `List Configurations`
- `Get Configuration Details`
- `List Workstations by Configuration`

### References
- [Terraform for Workstation Configuration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/workstations_workstation_config)

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

One-time setup requirements. Before running these pipelines:
  - Ensure that the following template has been created by running the corresponding job: `Cloud Workstations > Environment > Docker Image Template`
  - Ensure the Cluster has been created by running the corresponding job: `Cloud Workstations > Cluster Admin Operations > Create Cluster`

## Pipelines<a name="pipelines"></a>

Here are details about the six pipelines for Config Admin Operations:

### Create New Configuration<a name="pipelines-create-new-configuration"></a>
- This job creates a new Configuration for Cloud Workstations in your existing GCP project.
- This job fails if:
  - A configuration with same name already exists.
  - The Workstation Cluster does not exists. (Run `Create Cluster` operation pipeline in that case)
  
### Delete Existing Configuration<a name="pipelines-delete-existing-configuration"></a>
- This job deletes the specified Configuration.
- This job fails if:
  - Specified Configuration does not exists.
  - If the Configuration has child resources (i.e. Workstations), and won't delete the Configuration or any of its resources. (See [Known Issues](#known-issues) section)

### Update Existing Configuration<a name="pipelines-update-existing-configuration"></a>
- This job updates the specified Configuration.
- This job fails if the specified Configuration does not exists.
- **Important Notes**: 
  - This pipeline does NOT retain your original Config properties, i.e. whatever you set here, IS what the config will be. (Like create operation, but for an existing config)
  - You should leave a parameter empty, only if its "Optional" or has a "Default" value - and NOT because you think it will retain its original value - it will NOT.

### List Configurations<a name="pipelines-list-configurations"></a>
- This job displays a list of all existing Configurations of Cloud Workstations.
- This job fails if the specified Configuration does not exists.

### Get Configuration Details<a name="pipelines-get-configuration-details"></a>
- This job displays the full details of a specific Cloud Workstation Configuration.
- This job fails if the specified Configuration does not exists.

### List Workstations by Configuration<a name="pipelines-list-workstations-by-configuration"></a>
- This job displays a list of active Cloud Workstations that were created using a specific Configuration.
- This job fails if the specified Configuration does not exists.

## System Variables <a name="system-variables"></a>

There are a number of system environment variables that are unique to each platform but required by these Jenkins Cloud Workstation `Config Admin Operations` pipelines.

These are defined in Jenkins CasC `values-jenkins.yaml` and can be viewed in Jenkins UI under `Manage Jenkins` -> `System` -> `Global Properties` -> `Environment variables`.

These are as follows:
-   `CLOUD_BACKEND_BUCKET`
    - Name of the bucket that stores Terraform state for platform and cloud workstation resources (in separate folders).

-   `CLOUD_PROJECT`
    - The GCP project, unique to each project. Important for bucket, registry paths used in pipelines.

-   `CLOUD_REGION`
    - The GCP project region. Important for bucket, registry paths used in pipelines.

-   `HORIZON_GIT_URL`
    - The URL to the Horizon SDV git repository.

-   `HORIZON_GIT_BRANCH`
    - The branch name the job will be configured for from `HORIZON_GIT_URL`.

-   `JENKINS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
    - Service account to use for pipelines. Required to ensure correct roles and permissions for GCP resources.

Below variables have their values defined in `gitops/values.yaml` and then referenced in Jenkins CasC `values-jenkins.yaml`.

-   `CLOUD_WS_WORKLOADS_ENV_IMAGE_NAME`
    - Name of the Docker image on GCP Artifact registry, that is used as an environment for Cloud Workstations workload pipelines.
 
-   `CLOUD_WS_CLUSTER_PRESET_NAME`
    - Name of the Cloud Workstations Cluster. There can only be one cluster for cloud workstations and hence this is preset.
 
-   `CLOUD_WS_CLUSTER_PRESET_NETWORK_NAME`
    - Name of the network where Cloud Workstations resources are created on GCP.
 
-   `CLOUD_WS_CLUSTER_PRESET_SUBNETWORK_NAME`
    - Name of the subnetwork where Cloud Workstations resources are created on GCP.
 
-   `CLOUD_WS_CLUSTER_PRESET_PRIVATE_CLUSTER`
    - A preset property for Cloud Workstations Cluster.

## Known Issues
### Delete Existing Configuration
Currently, the Terraform configuration for Cloud Workstations available as part of `google-beta` provider, does not have a `force` or `cascade` delete option, and hence if the configuration has child resources (workstations) then simply running `Delete Existing Configuration` pipeline won't delete all of its resources.
- Follow below steps in order to delete a Config with existing workstations:
    1. **Delete Child Workstations**
        - Run the job `Config Admin Operations > Get Workstations by Configuration` to get the list of all existing workstations for the specified config.
        - Run the job `Workstation Admin Operations > Delete Existing Workstation` for every Cloud Workstation present in the list you got in the previous step.
    2. **Delete Configurations**
        - Run the job `Config Admin Operations > Delete Existing Configuration` for the configuration you want to delete, finally.
