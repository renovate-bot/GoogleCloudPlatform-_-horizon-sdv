## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This job is used to create pre-warmed persistent volumes with build caches used to improve performance for Android builds.

Run the jobs in parallel to ensure each build job has clean persistent volume.

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

One-time setup requirements.

- Before running this pipeline job, ensure that the following template has been created by running the corresponding job:
  - Docker image template: `Android Workflows/Environment/Docker Image Template`
- Ensure Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) have been deleted.

## Environment Variables/Parameters <a name="environment-variables"></a>

**Jenkins Parameters:** Defined in the groovy job definition `groovy/job.groovy`.

### `AAOS_GERRIT_MANIFEST_URL`

This provides the URL for the Android repo manifest. Such as:

- https://dev.horizon-sdv.com/gerrit/android/platform/manifest (default Horizon manifest)
- https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest (Google OSS manifest)

### `AAOS_REVISION`

The Android revision, i.e. branch or tag to build. Tested versions are below:

- `horizon/android-14.0.0_r30` (ap1a)
- `horizon/android-15.0.0_r36` (bp1a)
- `horizon/android-16.0.0_r3` (bp3a  - default)
- `android-14.0.0_r30` (ap1a)
- `android-15.0.0_r36` (bp1a)
- `android-16.0.0_r3` (bp3a)

### `ANDROID_VERSION`

This specifies which build disk pool to use for the build cache. If `default` then the job will determine the pool based on `AAOS_REVISION`.

### `ARCHIVE_ARTIFACTS`

Option to archive the build artifacts to bucket.

### `USE_LOCAL_AOSP_MIRROR`

If checked, the build will use the AOSP Mirror setup in your GCP project to fetch Android source code during `repo sync`.
**Note:**
-  The AOSP Mirror must be setup prior to running this job. If not setup, the job will fail.
-  The setup jobs are in folder `Android Workflows -> Environment -> Mirror`.

### `AOSP_MIRROR_DIR_NAME`

This defines the directory name on the Filestore volume where the Mirror is located.
**Note:**
-  This is required if `USE_LOCAL_AOSP_MIRROR` is checked.
-  e.g. If you provided `my-mirror` when creating the mirror, provide the same value here.

## SYSTEM VARIABLES <a name="system-variables"></a>

There are a number of system environment variables that are unique to each platform but required by Jenkins build, test and environment pipelines.

These are defined in Jenkins CasC `values-jenkins.yaml` and can be viewed in Jenkins UI under `Manage Jenkins` -> `System` -> `Global Properties` -> `Environment variables`.

These are as follows:

-   `ANDROID_BUILD_BUCKET_ROOT_NAME`
     - Defines the name of the Google Storage bucket that will be used to store build and test artifacts

-   `ANDROID_BUILD_DOCKER_ARTIFACT_PATH_NAME`
    - Defines the registry path where the Docker image used by builds, tests and environments is stored.

-   `CLOUD_PROJECT`
    - The GCP project, unique to each project. Important for bucket, registry paths used in pipelines.

-   `CLOUD_REGION`
    - The GCP project region. Important for bucket, registry paths used in pipelines.

-   `CLOUD_ZONE`
    - The GCP project zone. Important for bucket, registry paths used in pipelines.

-   `GERRIT_CREDENTIALS_ID`
    - The credential for access to Gerrit, required for build pipelines.

-   `HORIZON_DOMAIN`
    - The URL domain which is required by pipeline jobs to derive URL for tools and GCP.

-   `HORIZON_GIT_URL`
    - The URL to the Horizon SDV Git repository.

-   `HORIZON_GIT_BRANCH`
    - The branch name the job will be configured for from `HORIZON_GIT_URL`.

-   `JENKINS_AAOS_BUILD_CACHE_STORAGE_PREFIX`
    - This identifies the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) prefix that is used to provision persistent storage for build cache, ensuring efficient reuse of cached resources across builds.  The default is [`pd-balanced`](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/performance), which strikes a balance between optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.

-   `JENKINS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
    - Service account to use for pipelines. Required to ensure correct roles and permissions for GCP resources.

-    `MIRROR_PRESET_FILESTORE_PVC_MOUNT_PATH_IN_CONTAINER`

-    `MIRROR_PRESET_MIRROR_ROOT_SUBDIR_NAME`

-    `MIRROR_DIR_NAME`
