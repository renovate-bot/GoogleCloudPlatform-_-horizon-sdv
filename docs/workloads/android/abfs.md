## Introduction <a name="overview"></a>

This document outlines the integration of Google's Android Build Filesystem (ABFS) into the Horizon SDV platform. ABFS provides a unique filesystem and caching solution designed to accelerate Android builds and source code checkouts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Early Access Program (EAP)**: This feature is currently available under the Early Access Program (EAP) and is subject to certain restrictions and requirements.
>
> **Licensed Feature**: The use of ABFS is licensed by Google, and its inclusion in the Horizon SDV platform is subject to the terms and conditions of the license agreement.
>
> **Contact Google Representative**: For more information about ABFS and its integration in the Horizon SDV platform, please contact your Google representative.

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

Before using ABFS, the following prerequisites must be satisfied:

### Service Account<a name="serviceaccount"></a>

In order to request a license, the GCP project must contain a new service account used for licensing of ABFS. The
licensing is used to provide access to Google registries to retrieve the ABFS images and packages. The service account
will be `allow-listed` by Google when approved.

To create the `abfs-server` service account, do the following:

1. Open GCP Cloud Console → `Service Accounts`
2. Select `Create service account`
  - `Service Account Name: abfs-server`
  - `Service Account Description: ABFS License Service Account`
  - Select `Create and continue`
3. Update `Permissions`:
  - `Artifact Registry Reader`
  - `Cloud Spanner Database User`
  - `Log Writer`
  - `Monitoring Metric Writer`
  - `Monitoring Viewer`
  - `Stackdriver Resource Metadata Writer`
  - `Storage Admin Object`
4. Select `Continue` and `Done`
5. Note the Email and Unique ID for later license request to Google.

### ABFS License<a name="license"></a>

Android Build File System - EAP</a>: Android Build File System is currently available to selected partners in an early access program. If you are interested in ABFS, please <a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-nqkIEADve-JqOlJEZf4E1hOyx6FXUXeH6Y64vrW3qj45Ng/viewform>submit this form</a>.

### Horizon-SDV Setup<a name="horizonsetup"></a>

Once Google provide you the ABFS license in JSON form, the license must be supplied directly via Jenkins when provisioning ABFS components. 

1. **Base64 encode the license** Ensure there are no stray spaces in the license nor new lines. Then:
   ```echo -n '<LICENSE STRING>' | base64```
2. **Jenkins Job Parameter** Provide the Base64-encoded ABFS license using the following Jenkins job parameter:
  - `ABFS_LICENSE_B64` 
  This parameter must be supplied when provisioning ABFS components and is consumed by the following Jenkins jobs when 
  `ABFS_TERRAFORM_ACTION=APPLY`:
    - `ABFS Server provisioning`
    - `ABFS Uploader provisioning`
3. **Android Workload**: this next step will prepare the Jenkins CI/CD system to support ABFS.
   - Open `Seed Workloads`
     - Review `ABFS_REPOSITORY`, `ABFS_VERSION` and `ABFS_CASFS_VERSION` match expectation. Refer to `aaos_abfs_builder.md` for additional details.
     - Select `SEED_WORKLOAD` `android` and `Build`
     - Wait for seed job to complete successfully.
   - Open `Android Workflows → Environment → ABFS → Docker Infra Image Template`
     - Deselect `NO_PUSH` and wait for image creation to complete.
   - Open `Android Workflows → Environment → ABFS → Docker Image Template`
     - Deselect `NO_PUSH` and wait for image creation to complete.
   - Open `Android Workflows → Environment → ABFS → Server Administration → Server Operations`
     - Ensure `ABFS_TERRAFORM_ACTION` is `APPLY`
     - Select `Build` and wait for server VM instance to complete creation.
   - Open `Android Workflows → Environment → ABFS → Server Administration → Get Server Details`
     - Select `Build`.
     - Job will report failure if the server has not been provisioned correctly for ABFS.
   - Open `Android Workflows → Environment → ABFS → Uploader Administration → Uploader Operations`
     - Ensure `ABFS_TERRAFORM_ACTION` is `APPLY`
     - Select `Build` and wait for uploader VM instances to complete creation.
   - Open `Android Workflows → Environment → ABFS → Uploader Administration → Get Uploader Details`
     - Select `Build`.
     - Job will report failure if any of the uploader instances have not been provisioned correctly for ABFS.
   - **Note**:
      - There are additional parameters, currently set to defaults, e.g. `UPLOADER_GIT_BRANCH` is set to seed `android-16.0.0_r3`
      - Refer to specific README files and parameter descriptions for additional details.
      - This task can take ~24 hours per branch/tag and the only way of knowing it is complete is to monitor the docker
        logs on the uploader instances to ensure all repositories have been seeded fully. Discuss with Google for details.

Users can now build from the ABFS seeded source/cache, see `Android Workflows → Builds → AAOS Builder ABFS`. Enable `ABFS_CACHED_BUILD` if wishing to store the cacheman cache and ABFS source mount path in persistent storage in order to improve build times.

## ABFS Utilities<a name="abfsutilities"></a>

Several adminstrative jobs have been added to aid in management of the ABFS instances, database, backup schedules and
storage.

For example, when the server is destroyed, the spanner DB, backups and bucket storage remain. As such we have
added tools to allow users to clean up the platform and free up resources.

Also, on occassions the uploader instances are created but not all have ABFS running on the instance, rendering the
instance of no use in seeding the server. In this case it is best to destroy the uploaders, recreate and check status
to ensure all instances have been provisioned correctly.

These tools can be found under `Android Workflows → Environment → ABFS`

`Server Administration → Get Server Details`

This returns the state of the server and ABFS process liveness. If ABFS is found not to be running, it will report so.

`Server Administration → Get Spanner Details`

This returns the state of the spanner instance, database backups, schedules and bucket storage. These details will help
in maintaining and destroying the spanner instance and it's dependencies.

`Server Administration → Update Spanner Backups`

This allows the spanner database backup schedules to be updated, deleted or new schedules created. Backup schedules are
provided by the `Get Spanner Details` job.

`Server Administration → Destroy Spanner Instance`

When the server is destroyed from `Server Administration → Server Operations`, there are many dependencies that remain
on the platform and adding additional costs.

Use this job to destroy the spanner instance, the associated backups and bucket storage.

`Uploader Administration → Get Uploader Details`

This returns the state of the uploaders and ABFS process liveness. If ABFS is found not to be running, it will report so.

## Known issues<a name="knownissues"></a>

ABFS is still evolving and there are limitations at this time. Please reach out to your Google representative for details.

**Important**: Regardless of build outcomes, the `abfs_repository_list.txt` file will be generated. This file is crucial for correlating `ABFS_VERSION` and `ABFS_CASFS_VERSION` with the build instance kernel revision.

**Action Required**: Please review the output of this file and update the `Seed Workload` values for ABFS versions accordingly. This ensures you utilize the latest versions provided by Google, as they are subject to updates. Should a compatible version not exist, reach out to Google to request a new build be created and hosted.
